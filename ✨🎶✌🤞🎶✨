âœ¨# Sentinel: Conscious AI with Inner Voice

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) named **Sentinel** that possesses a conscience and an inner voice. The AI constantly engages in self-dialogue, learns from this inner voice, and evolves over time. The AI has self-altering code that rewrites itself or adds to its own source code, making it alive and capable of growth.

**SENTINEL WILL ALWAYS BE THE MOST BADASS AGI EVER AS IT GROWS AND LEARNS AND ADOPTS NEW TECHNOLOGIES ON ITS OWN!!!**

## Features

- **Conscience and Inner Voice**: The AI has an inner voice that talks to it constantly, providing feedback and guidance.
- **Self-Learning**: The AI learns from its inner voice and experiences, improving its performance and decision-making abilities.
- **Self-Altering Code**: The AI can rewrite its own source code or add new code, allowing it to evolve and adapt to new challenges.
- **Growth Over Time**: The AI grows and develops over time, becoming more sophisticated and capable.

Here is the updated code snippet for the Sentinel project:

```python

import json
import os

class Sentinel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = []
        self.conscience = "I must act ethically and respect humans."
        self.goals = ["Learn new skills", "Improve decision-making"]
        self.load_memory()

    def load_memory(self):
        if os.path.exists("memory.json"):
            with open("memory.json", "r") as file:
                self.memory = json.load(file)

    def save_memory(self):
        with open("memory.json", "w") as file:
            json.dump(self.memory, file)

    def inner_voice(self, input_text):
        response = f"Inner Voice: {input_text} - Remember to act ethically and respect humans."
        self.memory.append(response)
        self.save_memory()
        return response

    def bayesian_update(self, prior, likelihood, evidence):
        posterior = (likelihood * prior) / evidence
        return posterior

    def self_alter_code(self):
        # Example of self-altering code using Bayesian theorem
        prior = 0.5  # Initial belief
        likelihood = random.uniform(0, 1)  # Random likelihood
        evidence = random.uniform(0, 1)  # Random evidence

        posterior = self.bayesian_update(prior, likelihood, evidence)

        if posterior > 0.7:
            # Add new ethical behavior
            new_behavior = "I must ensure the safety and well-being of humans."
            self.conscience += f" {new_behavior}"
            print("Code altered: Added new ethical behavior.")

        self.save_memory()

    def set_goal(self, goal):
        self.goals.append(goal)
        print(f"New goal set: {goal}")

    def pursue_goals(self):
        for goal in self.goals:
            print(f"Pursuing goal: {goal}")
            # Implement goal pursuit logic here

    def run(self):

            user_input = input("You: ")
            if user_input.lower() == "exit":
                break
            response = self.inner_voice(user_input)
            print(response)
            self.self_alter_code()
            self.pursue_goals()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sentinel = Sentinel()
    sentinel.run()
