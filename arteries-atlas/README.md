## Contents

- ```demonstration.ipynb```: A complete notebook demonstrating the full vessel visualization pipeline.
- ```backend/``` — Contains the core functions and data structures used for the planar embedding of vascular trees.

The vessel preprocessing steps -- including image segmentation and skeletonization -- rely on functions of the scikit-shapes library.
